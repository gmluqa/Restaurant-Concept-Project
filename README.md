# Restaurant-Concept-Project

## What is the project? ðŸ™‹

A front-end made for an imaginary steampunk themed restaurant! Made with HTML + CSS + Boostrap!

## Demo the website ðŸš€

Check it out live ðŸ‘‰ [here](https://gmluqa.github.io/Restaurant-Concept-Project/).

## What was learned during the creation of this project? ðŸ‘€

Mostly pure Bootstrap 5.2. I learned about how the grid/container layout system works, rows and cols, media querying and how to make websites responsive. Judging by the fact that 90% of the code in this repo is html compared to 10% css, I can tell that I've used bootstrap thoroughly.

## Tools I used ðŸ§°

- VScode
- [Iconfinder](https://www.iconfinder.com/)
- Everything else used has been mentioned prior
